# Syria Tel Customer Churn 
## Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify customers at high risk of discontinuing SyriaTel’s telecommunications services
 (churn) and switching to other providers. Using a binary classification approach, the model will analyze historical customer behavior data to 
 assess churn likelihood. The insights generated will help SyriaTel implement proactive, data-driven retention strategies, strengthen customer 
 loyalty, and address churn challenges effectively.

## Business and Data Understanding
SyriaTel aims to enhance customer retention by identifying at-risk customers through a predictive model. Leveraging historical data, the 
initiative seeks to uncover actionable insights, enabling efficient resource allocation, reducing churn-related revenue loss, and improving 
customer experiences. This data-driven approach strengthens SyriaTel’s competitiveness in the telecom market.

Predictive Model for Customer Churn Mitigation

## Objectives:

- Identify key drivers of churn through feature analysis.
- Assess the impact of customer service on churn rates.
- Analyze customer behavior patterns to inform churn-reduction strategies.
## Metrics of Success
SyriaTel's churn prediction model will be evaluated using key industry benchmarks:

- Accuracy (80–90%): Proportion of correct predictions.
- Precision (70–90%): Correctly identifies actual churners.
- Recall (60–85%): Captures all actual churn cases.
- F1 Score (65–87%): Harmonizes precision and recall for overall performance.


## Explain your stakeholder audience and dataset choice here
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains 3,333 records and 21 features representing customer behavior and service usage. It includes 8
integer, 8 float, 4 object, and 1 boolean columns. The target variable, Churn, indicates whether a customer has terminated their service. 
Key features include account duration, usage metrics across different times of the day, subscription details, and customer interactions with
support services. This diverse dataset provides a comprehensive foundation for predicting churn and analyzing its drivers.
## Data preprocessing and data cleaning
The data didn't have missing values nor duplicates.


### Explotary Data Analysis (EDA)

- Univariate Analysis -

The goal here is to clearly visualize the data distribution, making it easier to identify its shape, spread, central tendency, and any outliers 
or patterns that may not be immediately apparent.
